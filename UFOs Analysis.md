# UFO Analysis

## Overview of Project
The UFO Finder was created to provide an interative website to allow visitors to search data for UFO sightings. The original UFO Finder had a date only filter. The UFO Finder has been updated to include additional filters: city, state, country, and shape. The user enters the criteria they wish to search on and a list is returned with the results if applicable. If no results are produced by the selected criteria, the table is empty. 

## Results
A visitor to the UFO Finder is able to enter any or all of the search criteria (date, city, state, country and shape) and the table on the right is populated with the results if the entered criteria matches any of the data collected to date. 

## Summary

A drawback to the current design is the inability to produce a report from the searched criteria. 

Two recommendations for updates to the UFO Finder would be the ability to produce a report from the searched criteria and the ability to add data.
